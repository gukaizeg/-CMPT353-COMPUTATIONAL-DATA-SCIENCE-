1.According to the analysis's findings, it is doubtful that daily temperatures alone can accurately forecast population density. Although there may be a relationship between temperature and population density, other elements, like economic possibilities, infrastructure, cultural and social qualities, and location, are likely to have a bigger impact. The intricacy and wide range of factors that affect population density might not be adequately captured by temperature alone.

2.For a few reasons, it may be quicker to work with compressed files than uncompressed ones when working with bigger data sets that are kept on disc throughout the investigation. In the first place, compressed files use less storage space, which lowers disc I/O operations and speeds up read/write operations. Second, by decompressing the files as they are being analysed, less data needs to be placed into memory, which leads to less memory use and quicker processing. In general, working with compressed files can aid in memory and disc use optimisation, resulting in more effective data processing.
