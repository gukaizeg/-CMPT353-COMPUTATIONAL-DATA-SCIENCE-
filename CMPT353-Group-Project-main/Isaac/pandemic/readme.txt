It seems that confining the timeframe to between 2020-01 and 2023-01 did not improve the models' predicting power.
I persume this is because the even less datapoints made linear and polynomial fits more difficult.
Most predictions got worse compared to the usual predictions done on the entire timeframe.
This perhaps shows there is no great enough difference of relation between covid cases and unemployment, during and not during the surge of covid infections.
