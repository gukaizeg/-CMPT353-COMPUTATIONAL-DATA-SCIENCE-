1.The residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value. According to the plot, we can find there is a symmetric distribution around zero,the residuals do indeed follow a normal distribution, so the assumptions of the OLS regression are met.
  The p-value given by the regression is very close to 0, indicating a statistically significant relationship between the timestamp (time) and the rating. If the residuals are indeed normally distributed, this p-value suggests that we can confidently reject the null hypothesis (which states that there's no relationship between time and ratings), and reasonably conclude that dog ratings are increasing over time.

2. Yes, it's better.In the update step, the Kalman filter uses the difference between the predicted and actual measurements (the residual) to update the current state estimate,the Kalman filter to do a better job of capturing the true signal amid the noise.
